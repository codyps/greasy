Removes the redirects & beacons that reddit adds to their links.

Unlike the reddit settings, this works even if you are logged out & means you don't need to trust those settings to work.

Compatible with RES "Never Ending Reddit" (newly loaded links are scrubbed too).

Supports

 - "inbound" and "outbound" tracking links/beacons
 - reddit-injected affiliate links (these appear to have been removed from reddit since the initial release)
