Removes the redirects & beacons that reddit adds to their links.

This works even if you are logged out and doesn't require that you trust
Reddit's settings to work while logged in.

Compatible with RES "Never Ending Reddit" (newly loaded links are scrubbed too).

Supports

 - "inbound" and "outbound" tracking links/beacons
 - reddit-injected affiliate links (these appear to have been removed from reddit since the initial release)
